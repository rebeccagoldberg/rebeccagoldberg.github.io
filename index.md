          I am passionate about creating opportunities for young people to lead and thrive. To do this, we must dismantle barriers to their success including addressing structural inequities that exist in our educational and nonprofit sectors. 
      - text: >
          I spent the last seven years in philanthropy leading a national youth development strategy as part of the [S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation's](http://sdbjrfoundation.org/) spend-down. Through that work, the importance of building  organizational capacity, making data-informed decisions, and addressing organizational and field-wide inequities became clear, especially in helping organizations navigate uncertainties. Before that, I led nonprofit initiatives focused on creating equitable learning environments for young people through youth development and career pathway programs.
