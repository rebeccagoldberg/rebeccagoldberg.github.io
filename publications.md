In December 2020, I was proud to close out the five-year, $126M National Character Initiative of the S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation as part of its foundation spend-down. Check out my [reflections on the initiative](https://www.issuelab.org/resources/37441/37441.pdf) and our grantees & partners' reflections on the initiative as captured by [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/resource/s-d-bechtel-jr-foundation-national-character-initiative-retrospective)

For my thoughts on evaluation, see the "Using Data for Learning: A Funder's Perspective" chapter in [Measure, Use, Improve! Data Use in Out-of-School Time published by Information Age Publishing](https://www.infoagepub.com/products/Measure-Use-Improve)

Learn more about the statewide strategy I led to infuse social-emotional learning practices in California's expanded learning programs [here](http://jyd.pitt.edu/ojs/jyd/article/view/2020-15-1-YWP-09). 

A chapter on three foundations' approach to funding social-emotional learning in [Social and Emotional Learning in Out-of-School Time by Information Age Publishing](https://www.infoagepub.com/products/Social-and-Emotional-Learning-in-Out-Of-School-Time).
